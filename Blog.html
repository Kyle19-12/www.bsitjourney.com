            <h2>Our First-Year Journey as BSIT Students: A Story of Growth and Resilience</h2>
            <h3>&#127881; Introduction</h3>
            <p>It was exciting and stressful to begin our adventure as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) students. Our academic and personal development was influenced by the new experiences, opportunities, and challenges that came with moving from senior high school to college. But with effort and the mind to achieve our goals, we transformed these difficulties into opportunities for achievement.</p>
            <h3>&#128218; First Semester: Overcoming the Initial Struggles</h3>
            <p>The first semester was full of ups and downs. We had to learn self-discipline, adapt to a new school, and take tough homework.</p>
            <ul>Here are some key topics we covered:
                <li><strong>&#128187; Computing Basics </strong> – Understanding how computers work and writing our first code.</li>
                <li><strong>&#128202;IT Mathematics</strong> – Developing problem-solving and analytical skills.</li>
                <li><strong>&#128483;Communication Skills</strong> – Learning to express ideas clearly.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to academics, we learned the importance of time management and teamwork. Stressful tests, late-night study sessions, and annoying problems in our programming were all part of the experience. But we endured and got better with hard work and determination.</p>
                
            <h3>&#128640; Second Semester: Gaining Confidence and Skill</h3>
            <p>By the Second Semester, we felt a little more confident and ready for new challenges. The subjects became more advanced, pushing us to think critically and apply our newly gained knowledge from the first semester.</p>
            <ul>
                 Here are some key topics we covered:
                <li><strong>&#127759;Web Development  Basics</strong> – Creating simple web pages using HTML, CSS.</li>
                <li><strong>&#9878; Ethics and Professionalism in IT</strong> – Understanding our responsibilities as future IT professionals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also started small projects. Despite the challenges, building something from scratch was a rewarding experience!</p>
            <h3>&#128293; Challenges and Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>In our first year, we faced challenges like tight deadlines, tough programming errors, and balancing studies with personal life!</p>
            <ul>
                But we learned important lessons:
                <li><strong>&#128170;Persistence is key</strong> – Coding can be frustrating, but practice and patience lead to improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>&#8987; Time management is crucial</strong> – Prioritizing tasks helps maintain productivity and reduces stress.</li>
                <li><strong>&#129309;Collaboration enhances learning</strong> – Working together provided different perspectives and solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>&#127775; Motivation and support matter</strong> – Encouraging each other kept us going during tough times.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>&#128218; Last-Minute Cramming Before Exams</h3>
                    <p>As exams approached, the pressure started building up. Some of us had well-organized study schedules, while others—like our friend—found themselves cramming at the last minute!</p>
                    
                    <div class="video-container">

                    </div>
                
                    <p>With coffee in one hand and notes in the other, we tried to absorb as much information as possible. The struggle was real, but we supported each other with review sessions, quick quizzes, and some much-needed laughter in between.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the end, we realized that while cramming can sometimes work, consistent studying is always the better approach. Lesson learned... until the next exam! &#128517;</p>
